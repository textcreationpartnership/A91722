         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N Obedience to this Right Honourable Houſe their Command, I ſhall here give an Account of
my admiſſion into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties preſence, and Commiſſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering this
Meſſage to the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who have thought fit it ſhould be
communicated to both Houſes of Parliament; For the firſt, partly my occaſions, partly my
deſire of ſeeing his Majeſty drew me to Sir <hi>William Ruſſels,</hi> where he was then
playing at Bowles with ſome of the Commiſſioners; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, Major Generall
<hi>Browne</hi> eſpying me, proffered me the honour of his Majeſties hand, which I readily
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, ſo it might be without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; and comming neare his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:160293:3"/>Majeſty, he was graciouſly pleaſed to grant
me that favour; withall asking my name, and ſomething elſe of Major Generall <hi>Browne,</hi>
which I heard not; but he ſoone after came to me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired my attendance at Court, where at
my entrance I was received by him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, and carried into the preſence
Roome, where he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me with ſeverall paſſages betwixt his Majeſty, the Generall,
Lievtenant-Generall, and Colonell <hi>Whaley,</hi> whom the King had that day ſtruck, for being
ſo preſumptuous as to liſten while his Majeſty was in conference with one whom they
ſuſpected to become from <hi>London;</hi> From this he fell to a relation of his Majeſties
averſeneſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe to comply at all with the Armies proceedings; ſaying,
<hi>That all their actions, for ought he ſaw, were both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equitable in themſelves, and
diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to their pretences:</hi> To this the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Generall added, That it did highly
concerne both the Parliament and City
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:160293:3"/>to be carefull of their ſafeties, he being an
eare witneſſe daily of their threats, and how much they are animated with the hopes of
ſpoile, and inraged with hatred to the Parliament; this he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to deliver, and ſo led
me into the Privie Chamber, and his Majeſty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came out of his Bed-chamber, He came
towards me, who was ſtanding with the Commiſſioners; then Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Browne</hi>
anticipated his Majeſties Diſcourſe by an humble intreaty, That he would be pleaſed to
confirme the Relation he had given me of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties unwillingneſſe to come from
<hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denby,</hi> and how much againſt his will he ſtayed here: In anſwer to which his
Majeſty clapping his hand on his breaſt, ſaid; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon my life I came againſt my
will,</hi> which he told me, I might well conjecture my ſelfe by the relation he was pleaſed to
afford me of his being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>Holdendy: But</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>rather then to be
carried by neck and heeles</hi> (that I may uſe his owne expreſſion)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:160293:4"/>
               <hi>I went along: Nor am I ſo in love with their
proceedings that I ſhould be willing to continue here, for I finde my ſelfe an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Priſoner. As concerning my refuſall of returning to</hi> Holdenby, <hi>which by ſome of my
Subjects may be miſ-underſtood, for all the reaſon I had was, that I choſe golden fetters,
and a lightſome roome before a darke Dungeon, for I conceive this to be the better Ayre, knowing
that my reſtraint there ſhould not be leſſe then here.</hi> Then appealing to the
Commiſſioners, he ſaid, <hi>Have I not told the Generall himſelfe, and others, That I
admired by what Authority he duſt thus reſiſt him and his Parliament:</hi> To which he
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, There was neceſſity. He told them, <hi>They did more then are the King, though in
the height of his power, durſt, to inforce Juſtice, either in criminall or Civill affaires;
Indeed I have many times haſtened it, but never inforc't it, as they have done, in ſaying, Give
us Juſtice, or— Yet for my part</hi> (proceeded his Majeſty) <hi>I know not what they do,
or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:160293:4"/>but what I heare from theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi>
pointing to the Commiſſioners, <hi>for they have not ſent legally to me ſince my comming;
therefore tell all thoſe whom you thinke fit Communicants of this buſineſſe, that I
deſire nothing more paſſionately, then to be with my Parliament.</hi> After this I
aſſum'd the boldneſſe to tell his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that I thought him then politically abſent,
when his affection, though not his Perſon, was alienated from them: To which he anſwered,
<hi>It was very right.</hi> Next I told him, I thought it would be no ſmall comfort to thoſe
whom he was pleaſed to make partakers of this his intention, that his Majeſties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion
and inclination towards them was ſo great; which he bid me aſſure them, whatſoever other
illuſive perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would poſſeſſe them to the contrary. And moreover, <hi>That if
he were at the head of their Army, he would declare and proteſt againſt all their proceedings;
And whatſoever they heard to the contrary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them not to beleeve, no, though under
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:160293:5"/>his hand, unleſſe they ſpake with one who had
it: from his owne mouth.</hi> Laſt of all, at my demand of ſome Letter, one of the
Commiſſioners, Major Generall <hi>Browne,</hi> anſwered, That that was not ſo ſafe, and
this would be as effectuall. This is all my memory ſupplyes me withall; the incompactedneſſe
of this Narration ſhall, I hope, obtaine your Honours pardons, being penned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt
